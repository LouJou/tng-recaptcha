Curl based recaptcha V2 implementation for TNG genealogy v12 software

BACKGROUND:
The existing recaptchalib.php library uses an implementation of "file_get_contents()" which doesn't return a verification response from Google when the recaptcha v2 option is activated in TNG version 12.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:
By substituting the file_get_contents() implementation with a curl implementation a verification response is received from Google which is used to permit the sending of the suggestion email when the recaptcha is solved succesfully.
